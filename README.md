This python script will check if your page is online and send an email if it's not. To set up first clone the repo and change the email address and url to your url and then make a cronjob to run it as often as you'd like.

To Set up:
----------

    $ git clone https://github.com/sean-smith/website_status.git
    $ crontab -t
